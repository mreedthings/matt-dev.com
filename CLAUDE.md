# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Personal website and learning platform for matt-dev.com. This project serves multiple purposes:
- Hobby coding and experimentation
- Learning DevOps practices (GitHub Actions, VPS management, environment separation)
- Potential microblogging platform
- Portfolio showcase
- Educational exploration with potential for future monetization

## Infrastructure

**VPS**: DigitalOcean droplet
**Domain**: matt-dev.com
**Environments**: Planning for dev/test/prod separation

## Development Philosophy

This is a learning-focused project. When working with code here:
- Prioritize educational value - explain DevOps concepts and best practices
- Consider GitHub Actions workflows for CI/CD automation
- Think about environment separation (dev/test/prod) from the start
- Balance between best practices and pragmatic solutions for a hobby project
- Document deployment and infrastructure decisions for future reference

## Key Learning Areas

- Git and GitHub workflows (branching, PRs, Actions)
- VPS management and deployment
- Environment configuration and secrets management
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as code concepts
